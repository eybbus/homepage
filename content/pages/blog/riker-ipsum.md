You enjoyed that. We know you're dealing in stolen ore. But I wanna talk about the assassination attempt on Lieutenant Worf. I'd like to think that I haven't changed those things, sir. Did you come here for something in particular or just general Riker-bashing? Yes, absolutely, I do indeed concur, wholeheartedly! Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Your head is not an artifact!
